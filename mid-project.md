Mid Project Review
==================

## Current Progress

A website has been made outlining the high-level overview of our project, found
[here](https://toshipiazza.github.io/LLVMCFG/). A checklist for the
deliverables for our project include:

- [ ] construct a basic block pass which instruments each conditional branch  
- [ ] write `__not_taken()` and `__taken()` functions for the above
  instrumentation  
- [ ] build a python script which colors an IDA control flow graph  
- [ ] build a python script which augments IDA control flow for indirect
  branches  

So far, the basic block pass has been attempted. Currently the pass runs, and
is able to accurately instrument each conditional branch and modify its target
and fallthrough branches. The stdlibc++ functionality has not been written that
will be our trampolines for keeping track of the branches, but is underway.
Once these have been completed, the python scripts will be written augmenting
IDA's current functionality. The python script for coloring branches should be 
relatively trivial in IDAPython but the updating IDA's existing CFG is quite ambitious.
There is precedent for modifying CFG using IDAPython but most open source options rely
on an external format to represent the CFG. More research is required to determine feasability in our timeframe.

## Delegation of Work

Toshi will work on the basic block pass. Kevin will construct the `__taken()`
and `__not_taken()` functions into libstdc++. Max will build a python script
that reads in the expected json, colors the basic blocks which were taken and
the basic blocks which were ignored, and augments IDA's control flow generation phase.

## Demo of Current Progress

Here, we run our `runpass.sh` script which runs our pass on the test.c file,
which has a conditional. It simply victimizes this conditional and points the
taken branch to `cfg::taken`, and the not-taken branch to `cfg::not_taken`.
Next, we will fill in these stub basic blocks with clean calls which will
notify some global state that a branch has been taken or not. It should be noted
that this demo does not deal with the taken / nottaken functionality of the compilation
of the json metadata.
