  "body": "# Overview\r\n\r\n###### Notice, this project is WIP\r\n\r\nLLVMCFG is an llvm pass that modifies the code generation phase of the clang compiler. Given some source code, the generated code will keep track of all branches taken at runtime, and outputs a dynamically computed control flow graph. This project was inspired by the `cbr.c` and `cbrtrace.c` samples in the DynamoRIO code base which compute the control flow dynamically using dynamic binary instrumentation.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nIn order to compute the dynamic control flow graph, we must specifically target conditional branch instructions:\r\n\r\n``` {.nasm}\r\n; <label>1:\r\n  ; ...\r\n  br i1 %2 %3 %4\r\n\r\n; <label>3:\r\n  ; skip all phi nodes, etc\r\n  call void @__note_taken(i8* blockaddress(@main, %1), i8* blockaddress(@main, %3))\r\n  ; original fallthrough instrumentation\r\n\r\n; <label>4:\r\n  ; skip all phi nodes, etc\r\n  call void @__note_taken(i8* blockaddress(@main, %1), i8* blockaddress(@main, %4))\r\n  ; original target instrumentation\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, given a conditional branch instruction we find the fallthrough basic block and the taken basic block, and we add a call to `__note_taken()`, which keeps state. We use the `blockaddress()` mechanism for the general case to get the addresses of basic blocks.\r\n\r\nNote that `blockaddress(entry)` cannot be taken; that is, we cannot take the address of a basic block which serves as the entry point to a function. So, we use the alternative IR:\r\n\r\n``` {.nasm}\r\ncall void @__note_taken(i8* bitcast (i32 ()* @main to i8*), i8* blockaddress(@main, %3))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we take the address of main (and thus of the entry basic block), and cast it to a `void *` to be used as the argument to `__note_taken()`.\r\n\r\nInternally, `__note_taken()` simply inserts the source and target addresses into an `unordered_map<uintptr_t, unordered_set<uintptr_t>>` data structure. In order to output the results, we use [this json library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) to convert this data structure intuitively into json:\r\n\r\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/dcilkxl32doq04axpfevf3cbl.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/dcilkxl32doq04axpfevf3cbl)\r\n\r\n# Applications\r\n\r\n## Branch Coverage\r\nOnce we have constructed the dynamically computed CFG, we can \"diff\" this against a more complete, statically computed control flow graph in order to determine which branches were not taken at runtime.\r\n\r\n## Static Analysis Aide\r\nSometimes certain static analysis tools like IDA and radare2 will miss certain dynamic control flow instructions (`[call|jmp] rax`) as they are computationally hard to determine statically. Examples of these include switch-case statements and jump tables. Given a \"good\" execution of a program, we can likely reconstruct a good portion of the switch-case statement very simply.",
